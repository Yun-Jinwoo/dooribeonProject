# DooriBeonProject: Crosswalk Monitoring System

## Introduction:

*DooriBeonProject* is an open source project that monitors crosswalks for vehicles that violate traffic laws. The purpose of our system is to detect vehicles that violate traffic regulations, obtain an image of those vehicles, and recognize their license plates. From a picture of a vehicle, if it is possible to recognize at least four characters (including four), we would like to save the pictures and save the recognized result (in text form) into a separate folder for each car, bus, and truck. The primary objective of our program is to detect vehicles that violate traffic rules and to report them to the appropriate authorities without causing confusion or prolonging the process. 

###### The project build based on 3 diffrent program:

- mainFile.py

- sort.py

- ANPR.py
